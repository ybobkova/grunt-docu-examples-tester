This is the File, where I test, if the function pasteExampleToDocs() pastes the text that I give right.

In the original file could stay some examples, or just explanations and comment, as usual in documentation files. The function should find the example, that I want to be changed and change it with the text I give it. In this file, the function must find the example with the comment "//BlaExample: here is the new example pasted" and change the example text of the example without changing the comment itself.

This is that example:

### basic class

```js
// BlaExample: here is the new example pasted
First Example
```

And that's one more example, so that I can control the other functions:

```js
// BasicClassExample: Classes can be created
Second Example
```
