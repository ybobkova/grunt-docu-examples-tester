# grunt-docu-examples-tester

This grunt plugin is written in order to help developers test examples, that they use in their documemtation.


## Installation

`npm install grunt-docu-examples-tester`


## Usage

`grunt pull-examples` takes examples out of the documentation files, creates a test for each example, if it not already exists.
If it exists, the actual example will be pasted in it.

`grunt push-examples` takes examples from the tests and pastes them into the documentation files


## Settings

```
"pull-examples": {
  def: {
    src: ["docs/**/*.md"], // path to the documentation files
    templates: ["lib/tasks/files/"], // path to the test-templates
    tests: ["tests/Cojoko/examples/"]  //path to the tests
  }
}

"push-examples": {
  def: {
    src: ["docs/**/*.md"], //path to the documentation files
    tests: ["tests/Cojoko/examples/"]  //path to the test files  
  }
}
```

### Notice to the examples in the documentation files

Examples should be written in the format:

```
    ```js(or javascript)
    //<exampleName>Example: <exampleDescription>
    ...
    ```
```

For example:

```
    ```js
    // basicClassExample: Classes can be created
  
    Cojoko.Class('ACME.Exchange.Share', {

      properties: {
        title: { is: 'rw', required: true, isPrivate: true },
        isin: { is: 'rw', required: true, isPrivate: true },
        wkn: { is: 'rw', required: true, isPrivate: true },
        price: { is: 'rw', required: true, isPrivate: true, type: 'ACME.Exchange.Price' }
      },

      methods: {
        toString: function () {
          return this.title+' ('+this.isin+'/'+this.wkn+')';
        }
      }
    });
    ```
```


### Notices to the template

1. The template can contain placeholders <exampleName> and <exampleDescription>. Thay will be changed correspondingly.

2. The test template should contain lines /*beginning of the example*/ and /*end of the example*/, so the tasks can paste and parse an example correctly.

For example:

```
    ```js
    describe("Classes", function () {
      it("can be created", function () {
        /* beginning of the example */
        Cojoko.Class("ACME.Exchange.Share", {
          properties: {
            title: {
              is: "rw",
              required: true,
              isPrivate: true
            }
          },
          methods: {
            toString: function () {
              return this.title + " (" + this.isin + "/" + this.wkn + ")";
            }
          }
        });
        /* end of the example */
    
        assert.equal(true, true);
      });
    });
    ```
```
